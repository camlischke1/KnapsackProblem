# KnapsackProblem
You are given a knapsack of capacity W and n items with weights {wi} and values {vi}. Each item may be included at most once. This program finds the optimal solution to a given knapsack problem.

(1) Implement the dynamic programming algorithm described above that uses O(nW) space and runs in O(nW) time.
(2) Implement a new version of the algorithm that uses only O(W) space (still O(nW) time) by maintaining only a small portion of the table at any given time. 


Execution instructions:

	python knapsack.py


**If you would like to change the input file, it is easily changed in TWO spots within my code.
